# my-website
This website contains information about myself, my blog articles and the projects I build. Front end project built with react and typescript, and tested with jest and react testing library.

I always wanted to build my own website to showcase my projects and experience, so I defenitely enjoyed building this. Moreover, I used this project to learn how to use react with typescript, test react projects with jest and react testing library and consume GraphQL APIs with Apollo client.

Characteristics:
- Front end built with React and Typescript.
- State management with Redux.
- Navigation with React router.
- Fully responsive design and styling with SASS.
- Blog articles served through Hashnode GraphQL API, consumed with Apollo client.
- Tested with Jest and React testing library.
